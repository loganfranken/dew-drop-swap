## Modifying

This project uses [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). To modify the JavaScript
files, you'll need to first run the following commands:

```
npm install
npx webpack --config webpack.config.js
```

After that, webpack will watch the JavaScript files for any changes and
generate an updated ``bundle.js`` file.

## Music Assets

The music and sound assets were purchased from the Unity Asset Store 
([Interface and Item Sounds](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/interface-and-item-sounds-89646)
and [A Casual Music Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/music/a-casual-music-pack-160915)).
